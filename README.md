# Face_detection

This project is an OpenCV project used to detect faces in an image using Haar Cascades and is implemented in Python programming language.
Haar Cascades is basic method for face detection and uses edge detection to determine whether an object in an image is a face or not.

Some ways of minimising the noise sensitivity is by modifying the scaleFactor or minNeighbours in the code.
